# Security Controls

## GitHub OIDC Authentication

The platform uses GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate GitHub Actions workflows with AWS.

Benefits include:

* No long-lived AWS access keys
* Temporary credentials
* IAM role assumption
* Secure CI/CD authentication
* Reduced credential management overhead

---

## Container Security

Container images are scanned using Trivy during deployment.

The pipeline:

1. Builds the Docker image
2. Performs vulnerability scanning
3. Fails deployments on Critical vulnerabilities
4. Pushes approved images to Amazon ECR

---

## Network Security

Security controls include:

* Private EC2 instances
* Private RDS deployment
* Security Group segmentation
* No public database access
* Session Manager access instead of SSH

---

## Edge Security

Public traffic is protected using:

* AWS WAF
* CloudFront
* Private S3 bucket
* Origin Access Control (OAC)

---

# Deployment Configuration Store

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is used to store the currently approved container image URI for each environment.

Deployment workflow:

1. GitHub Actions builds and scans the Docker image.
2. The image is pushed to Amazon ECR.
3. GitHub Actions updates the image URI stored in Parameter Store.
4. An Auto Scaling Group instance refresh is triggered.
5. EC2 instances retrieve the image URI from Parameter Store.
6. EC2 instances pull the approved image from Amazon ECR.

This approach separates infrastructure deployments from application deployments and allows application versions to be updated without modifying Terraform infrastructure code.

---

# Monitoring and Alerting

The platform includes operational monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS.

### CloudWatch Alarms

Implemented alarms include:

* High EC2 CPU Utilisation
* ALB Unhealthy Host Detection

### SNS Integration

SNS provides notification capabilities for operational events and CloudWatch alarms.

---

# Drift Detection

Terraform drift detection is implemented through GitHub Actions.

The workflow:

1. Retrieves Terraform state
2. Executes Terraform Plan
3. Detects infrastructure drift
4. Reports deviations from source-controlled infrastructure

This helps ensure deployed infrastructure remains aligned with Terraform definitions.
